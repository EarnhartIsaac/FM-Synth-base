**FM-Synth-base**

This repo is the base code for a plugin FM synthesizer (VST2/VST3/AAX/Stand-alone) that
utilizes the WDL-OL version of IPlug along with RtAudio's ASIO interface. This code sits under the MIT License and can be modified and distributed freely so that developers may use it and expand upon it for whatever application. 

An added thanks to Martin Finke and his blog which provided a good starting point and whose name appears on files
that he originally wrote along with changes to support the FM architecture.
